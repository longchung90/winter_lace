    "John Rollin’s data methodology outlines 10 stages that guide data scientists in solving complex problems and making data-driven decisions. While this Python project doesn’t focus on the methodology, it’s always best practice to follow it, especially for real-world scenarios.\n",

    "The data understanding stage is the fifth stage, so we should revisit the first stage, business understanding, to recapture the business problems, data needed, goals, and objectives for this project. The project introduction helps identify these.\n",
    "#### What was the business problem?\n",
    "- The recruitment agency was facing a challenge in efficiently identifying potential job openings for its clients. Manual job searches over multiple sites were time-consuming and risky, potentially missing out on job ads that could affect clients’ employment prospects.\n",
    "#### What did the business need?\n",
    "- The agency urgently needs an analytical tool to expedite its job search process. It should automatically grab job postings from multiple marketplace websites and provide them to clients as part of its service.\n",
    "#### What does the business aim to achieve?\n",
    "- The agency in this scenario aims to improve the efficiency of their job vacancy sourcing process through the web-scraping tool.\n",
    "- The agency can quickly find relevant job openings from multiple posting sites, so they’ll have a better chance of finding many great opportunities before others. This; therfore, helps them improve the quality of job vacancies they source.\n",
    "The  two objectives once achieved will make the business and its clients more competitive in the job market as this project deliverable to enhance the quality of their service with higher accuracy and up-to-date with the currency. That will be the ultimate goal.\n"

    "Having identified the business problem with its goals and objectives, I progressed to the stage of constructing the tools to help the business achieve the outcomes. From my understanding, the data that the business required would simply consist of job position listings from several posting sites. The agency might have its own list of job-posting websites that they use or partner with. I would need to ask the agency to supply me with the list of their target websites; however, for now, in Australia, I consider scraping the data from the following pages:\n",

I will probably advise the business to obtain a permission and User-agent's licence that will permit it to scrape freely.\n",

If my tools request information from them and the responses come back as negative or not accurate data, then it will be hard to judge whether the tools are functional or the scraping is actually forbidden.\n",

However, *Scrapy* is designed for **large-scale** web scraping projects, with multiple pages whilst *BeautifulSoup*, though easy to use, is intended for smaller projects with a few pages. BeautifulSoup lacks a pipeline for processing and storing the scraped data. Within the Scrapy framework, the Spider module written in Python can crawl through the pages to extract the data and exported as JSON files, which can be conveniently opened by Jupyter notebook."

    "I have finally reached this stage, the conclusion of the project. What a journey it has been for me in using Python to build the web-scraping tool for the recruitment agency in particular and for business and future employers in general. The project has allowed me to apply effectively what I learnt about Python from the data science course(s) to solve real-world problems. The process was not so straightforward, as I mentioned in the title of this notebook; it was an excursion into web-scraping with Python, and I took a detour into the Scrapy framework to find out if that approach could help. I also spent quite a lot of my time on the anti-scraping topic because I think it is very important to be compliant rather than being sorry down the track. I want to demonstrate that the work I deliver is of quality and the highest ethical standards, always. For example, I contacted Seek.com.au and LinkedIn seeking their permission to scrape. This was the right thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the beginning of this project, I spent a fair bit of time thinking about the scenario and enlarged it in a practical sense so that I could gain a deeper understanding and be more connected to the project. I exercised critical thinking by referring back to the data methodology by John Rollin because the methodology truly teaches data scientists to think while doing. I find the methodology most practical, yet applying it requires us to think further and customise for data projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During this Python excursion, I not only learnt application but also coupled the theory and the practical of my Python knowledge. This now clearly demonstrates my skills match the proficient level of a Python user for such a project. I read every document suggested in the instruction and followed every link, further enhancing my gained knowledge, helping me identify new resources for my future projects and career development. I acknowledge greatly the AI Coach on the Coursera learning platform. The Coach is an amazing model for learning and teaching, especially in such coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology advances, I am always open to continued learning so to remain current and to work more efficiently, an open mindset being an integral way forward. Whilst aiming to become a Data Scientist, I cannot go past the presence and the need of AI. It’s for this reason that I am growing my AI Generalist skills also. They complement each other incredibly well. Such skills and capability will equip me to advise organisations on their AI journey, including integration likely to lead to their desired transformation, whilst uplifting productivity. This course and this project has facilitated my abilities to code with confidence, something new as I didn’t code a lot in my previous Scientist roles. I understand better Python, the code sets and the coding principles. By using the AI Coach and applying my critical thinking and experience with (writing) prompts, I was able to piece together all components and elements to deliver the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a PhD with a background in biochemistry and genomics. My science journey has been quite eventful and I had been previously working mainly in research laboratories and with -omics data. I am curious and serious about a career in data science and I look forward to an exicitng opportunity."
