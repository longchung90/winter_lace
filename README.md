## Watch this space: Python projects 
Thank you for visiting my page! In this branch Project, you will be able to view projects and notebooks that I have done with Coursera IBM.

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Python:
**Notes:**
       * For the UK retail exploratory data project, I uploaded a wrong file and have updated the correct version named as UK_retail_exploratory_data_analysis

       * Apologies if this has caused any inconvenience
       
## Web-scraping tool project
       * The project employed the BeautifulSoup module to parse down the HTML file requested to the web page 
       * By using a combination of methods such as find() and find_all() as well as other parameters such as class, tag and attributes, the user can retrieve the data and information they need.
       * Warning about the anti-scraping rulings discussed in the notebook
       * A brief comparison with the Scrappy framework
       * The Fake Job posting was used due to the anti-scraping rulings
       * Should try other job-posting sites from Python 

## Output files
       * Job_listings_scientist.csv
